###Compiler Construction Labs
This repository contains a series of compiler construction lab projects exploring the design and implementation of a Python-to-x86 compiler. The project includes a minimal runtime system, a compiler wrapper script (pyyc), and a Makefile for convenience.

These labs are designed to be flexible and open-ended, allowing for experimentation with various compilation strategies, optimizations, and intermediate representations.

##🔧 Using the Compiler
The compiler takes a .py file as input and generates an equivalent .s x86 assembly file. The default setup assumes you're using Python 3.10 and that the main compiler entry point is at src/pyyc/compile.py.

You can modify the pyyc wrapper script if your compiler location or Python
🛠 Build & Run Instructions
1. Build the runtime system (if not already built):

bash
Copy
Edit
make -C runtime
2. Build the compiler:

bash
Copy
Edit
make
3. Compile a test Python program:

bash
Copy
Edit
./pyyc mytests/test1.py
4. Link the generated assembly with the runtime:

bash
Copy
Edit
gcc -m32 -g mytests/test1.s runtime/libpyyruntime.a -lm -o mytests/test1
5. Run the compiled binary:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat mytests/test1.in | mytests/test1 > mytests/test1.out
6. Generate the expected output using Python 3.10:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat mytests/test1.in | python3.10 mytests/test1.py > mytests/test1.expected
7. Compare your program's output:

bash
Copy
Edit
diff -w -B -u mytests/test1.expected mytests/test1.out
You can automate some of these steps using make targets included in Test.mk.

##🧪 Automated Testing
A testing framework is included using pytest, which makes it easy to validate the compiler across a wide range of test cases.

Run tests on your own suite:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd tests
pytest --pyyctests mytests
Run tests on pre-written groups (e.g., autograde/p0/easy):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd tests
pytest --pyyctests autograde
Tests are organized by difficulty and feature coverage to aid iterative development.

##💡 Goals of This Project
Implement a full compiler pipeline from Python to x86

Explore register allocation, control flow graphs, and interference graphs

Understand low-level code generation and runtime system interaction

Build a system that can be tested against real programs

##📦 Environment Setup
To isolate dependencies, consider using pipenv or venv to manage Python versions and required packages.
